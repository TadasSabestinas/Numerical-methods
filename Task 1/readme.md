# Task 1

Find the interval that contains one of the given equation
solution, and solve the equation. Provide a program that calculates the solution of the equation with precision Ïµ; a table of calculation iterations (iteration number, nth product, error between iterations, etc.); graph(s) showing at least several iterations of the solution. Solve the equation using bisection and fixed-point iteration method.

Equation: e^-x = x
