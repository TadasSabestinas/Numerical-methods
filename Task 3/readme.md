# Task 3.1

Program that solves the 5th order interpolation polynomial with f(x) = e^-x \* (x^3 -2x -1) in interval [0, 5].

Divides the interval into n smaller intervals of equal length and gets n+1 equally spaced interpolation nodes, counts the value of the function in them and uses it for interpolation and error calculation. Graphs the polynomial by marking the interpolation points and compares the interpolation polynomial as well as the original function.

# Task 3.2

Finds the coefficients of the quadratic spline using the boundary condition for the derivative at the point x0 where the derivative for the initial point x0 is obtained from finite differences. Solves a system of linear equations by utilizing LU decomposition and finds the coefficients. Plots the resulting spline and compares it to the graph of the given functions.
