# Task 4.1

Reads the data from a text file which includes n coordinates x, y for data points. Program approximates a0+a1x and a0+a1x+a2x^2 functions and plots the approximated functions on the graph, shows which function is a better fit.

# Task 4.2

Calculates the approximate values of the integral using numerical integration right rectangles method. For each h, calculates the error. Finds the true value of the integral and compares it with the found approximation, i.e. calculates the true error. Makes a table for different h from the approximate value of the integral, approximate and exact errors.

# Task 4.3

Uses adaptive integration algorithm to find the value of the integral using recursion to split the interval into two halves and recursively calculate integrals for each half. The depth of recursion is determined by the initial numbers of subintervals n.
