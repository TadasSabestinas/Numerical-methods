# Task 2.1

Solve the nonlinear system of equations AX = F(X) with epsilon accuracy using the iteration method AX^(k+1) = F(X^(k)) and computing the error with the maximum norm. Solve the resulting system of equations in each iteration using LU decomposition. Create the diagonal matrix An\*n and the vector function F(X) of length N as follows:

Calculate separately: a) the working time of the decomposition of Lu by changing N. b) the time of solving the equations with triangular matrices themselves. Use this to estimate the size complexity of these algorithms.
